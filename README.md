# employee-summary

This app generates an HTML page displaying all the employees on a team that is defined by the user. When this app starts, the user is asked for information on the manager of the team. After the manager's information is entered, the user can then add however many engineers and/or interns as they want. After the whole team is entered, an HTML file is generated that displays every person on the team.
